## üöÄ Getting Started

Prerequisites:
-	Node.js (v14 or later)
-	npm or yarn
-	An OpenAI API key

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/TheEnigmaThatIsMe/RandomSubjectLine.git
cd RandomSubjectLine
npm install
```

## Setup
Create a .env file (or directly replace in the code) and add your OpenAI API key:
```env
REACT_APP_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```
> Note: The current implementation passes the key via the client (with dangerouslyAllowBrowser: true), which is not secure. For production use, implement a backend proxy.

## Run the App
```bash
npm run dev
```
The app will be available at [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/).

## üß† How It Works
-	The app uses OpenAI's `chat.completions.create` method with GPT-4o.
-	You select a style from a dropdown.
-	On click, the app sends a prompt like:
"Generate a friendly email subject line."
-	The AI returns a creative subject line based on the selected style.

## üõ°Ô∏è Disclaimer

This project sends API requests directly from the browser, which can expose your API key. Use a secure backend if deploying publicly.
