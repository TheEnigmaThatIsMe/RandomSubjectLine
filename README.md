Random Subject Line Repository

Random Subject Line is a website created as a personal project to test out a database and sharpen HTML/CSS/JS skills.
The idea behind RSL is a simple one:

##Sometimes you need a bit of randomness to spice things up!

RSLs function is as easy as can be. There is a button on the page and when this button is hit, a random subject line is provided to you to use for whatever you desire.
